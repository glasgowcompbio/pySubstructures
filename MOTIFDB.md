# Selected Motif Sets from MS2LDA MotifDB

The following document outlines a selection of motif sets exported from the MS2LDA MotifDB (https://ms2lda.org/motifdb) using the `dump_motifdb.py` script. This selection prioritizes scientifically relevant and community-contributed motif sets, excluding test entries and those with unclear descriptions. Each motif set has been chosen for its significance in various scientific analyses, including plant extracts, bacterial symbionts, and chemical libraries.

## Motif Set Overview

The table below provides an overview of each selected motif set, including its ID, name, feature set, description, and the number of motifs it contains.
